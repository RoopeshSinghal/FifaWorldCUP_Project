# FifaWorldCUP_Project
This project will embark on a journey through the FIFA World Cup, using three datasets to unveil the stories behind the beautiful game: World Cup (tournament information), World Cup Matches (individual match details), and World Cup Players (player information).

1. Data Cleaning and Processing: Preparing the Pitch

Before we step onto the field, we'll ensure our data is in top shape. This involves removing any missing values (NaN) and special characters that might hinder our analysis. Just like a well-maintained pitch, clean data is essential for a smooth game.

2. Goals! Goals by Country

Now it's time to turn our attention to the heart of the game: goals! We'll delve into the datasets to identify which countries have consistently found the back of the net throughout World Cup history. This analysis will reveal the top scorers and potential underdogs waiting to be unleashed.

3. Fan Frenzy: Attendance

The World Cup is more than just a competition; it's a spectacle that ignites a global passion for football. We'll investigate attendance trends across different tournaments to see how fan support has evolved over time. Here, we'll identify the matches that have packed the most punch in terms of spectators and the stadiums that boast the highest average attendance, revealing the most electrifying atmospheres.

4. Tournament Growth: Number of Teams, Goals, and Matches per Cup

The World Cup itself has transformed over the years. To understand this growth, we'll analyze the number of teams participating, the total number of goals scored, and the number of matches played in each tournament. This will showcase the expansion of the competition and potential changes in playing styles.

5. Goals Galore: Goals Per Team Per World Cup

For a deeper look at scoring trends, we'll calculate the average goals scored by each team in each World Cup. This analysis might unearth interesting patterns in how teams approach the competition offensively throughout the years.

6. National Glory: Podium Positions by Country

Every team dreams of lifting the World Cup trophy. We'll identify the countries that have consistently stood on the podium (finishing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) throughout history. This will reveal the most decorated nations and potential future contenders.

7. Home Advantage: Match Outcomes by Home and Away Teams Finally, we'll examine how home and away teams fare in matches. Does playing on home soil truly provide a significant advantage? By analyzing match outcomes, we'll explore this age-old question and uncover the strategies that lead to success on both sides of the pitch.

By delving into these various aspects, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the FIFA World Cup and the captivating stories it tells through the power of data.
